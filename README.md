# Project_Predition of Medical Charges with Linear Regression Model

Linear Regression is a supervised and statistical method used for modeling and analyzing the relationship between a dependent variable (also called the target) and one or more independent variables (predictors or features). It assumes a linear relationship between the variables.

Linear regression is widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, biology, and social sciences, for tasks such as predicting stock prices, analyzing the impact of marketing campaigns, studying the relationship between variables, and more.

The primary goal of this technique is to find the best-fitting linear equation that describes the relationship between the variables. This equation can be used to make predictions and understand the strength and direction of the relationship. Hence, the name is Linear Regression.

In order to be profitable, a healthcare insurance company must generate revenue exceeding its expenses related to the healthcare of policyholders. The unpredictability of medical costs, largely stemming from infrequent occurrences of severe health conditions, poses a significant challenge.

Examine the company's historical data, with the primary goal to develop a regression model that can effectively forecast medical charges and assess the model's prediction accuracy.

Furthermore, identify the specific factors or features that exert the most influence on medical charges and providing an in-depth analysis of their impact.

For detailed analysis, insights, codes, graphs, observations, model performance & accuracy, please refer to the project.
